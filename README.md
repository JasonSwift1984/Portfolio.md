## Some Projects I've Worked On

### Creating Custom Sonar Rules

- [Pull Request 182](https://git.rockfin.com/AMP/custom-sonar-rules/pull/182)
- [Pull Request 107](https://git.rockfin.com/AMP/custom-sonar-rules/pull/107)

In this project, I developed custom Sonar rules to enforce coding standards. These rules include checking for unencrypted secrets in the code and ensuring buffer names follow our coding standards. By preventing data leakage in the database and maintaining uniform coding styles, these rules significantly improve data security and code readability. Technologies used: Java, Maven, Progress, and GitHub.

### AppHub Validation

- [Pull Request 13926](https://git.rockfin.com/AMP/ampgate/pull/13926)

I implemented validation for AppHub, ensuring that each item in codeowners is properly correlated to Business Criticality, Status, and Source Control URL. This update also enforces that new files belong to a capability, acting as a hard gate. By doing so, we enhance program ownership identification and facilitate smoother communication within the team. Technologies used: Python and Bash.

### Main Message Definition Screen

- [Ticket 2848350]

In this project, I added an additional filter to the Main Message Definition Screen, providing team members with easier navigation and time-saving options. This customization has been tailored to meet the needs of Property Qualifier Teams, specifically Tonya Seymour. Technologies used: Progress 4GL.

### Cascade Tool

- [Ticket 3088451]
- [Ticket 3054208]
- [Ticket 3068595]

The Cascade Tool I developed enables efficient updates to team members' information across all loans, managing permissions and security records. The tool includes a mass status update screen, optimized for business hours, as well as a scheduled update screen for overnight processing. Additionally, the tool sends email notifications to BAs for updates after each cascade run. These features ensure data accuracy and streamline the updating process, benefiting the business and its users. Technologies used: Progress 4GL.

### Rocket Logic Toolbox

- [Frontend Repository](https://git.rockfin.com/BusinessApplicationEngineering/RL-Toolbox-UI)
- [Backend Repository](https://git.rockfin.com/BusinessApplicationEngineering/RL-Toolbox-BFF)

Currently, I am actively collaborating with my team to connect the frontend to the backend for Rocket Logic Toolbox. My contributions include creating API calls to credit data orchestrator and implementing SQS for data synchronization. These enhancements empower users to compare data between Rocket Logic Toolbox and Open AMP, ensuring alignment and facilitating seamless data updates. Technologies used: Typescript.

## Mentorship

In the past year, I've had the invaluable opportunity to be mentored by three team members, each with over 20 years of coding experience and diverse exposure to AMP. I have learned various techniques, including object creation in Amp, and shared this knowledge with my team and others interested in programming. I am eager to continue learning and contributing to the growth of my colleagues and the organization.

## Technical Excellence

### Mastering My Craft

I am dedicated to continuous improvement and consistently seek opportunities to enhance my skills and add value to Rocket Mortgage. Some recent training endeavors include:

- Agile Training: Emphasizing the importance of breaking down projects into manageable iterations.
- Team Learning on LinkedIn: Business Software and Tools: Exploring time management tools for small projects.
- Team Learning on LinkedIn: Data Science: Gaining insights into data cleaning and applying data models.
- Hack Week - Machine Learning with Don Ward: Learning machine learning for data science using Kaggle.
- Hackathon Project: Posture Monitor: Developing an application to monitor posture using Python and camera integration.
- Sonar Rules with Ken Herring: Advancing expertise in creating Sonar rules using Visual Studio Code.
- Amazon Sage Maker Canvas with Jordan LaFramboise: Understanding how non-engineers develop machine learning models, bridging the gap between business and engineering.
- AWS Pipelines with Jordan LaFramboise: Gaining hands-on experience in building near serverless real-time data processing pipelines on AWS, expanding overall data knowledge.

### Problem Solving

In my role on the Business Application Engineering Team, I am frequently tasked with researching and finding solutions. For instance, during my research on MyVault, I identified and implemented a Sonar Rule to prevent potential data leakage, ensuring data security. I approach problem-solving with diligence and a focus on practical, effective solutions.

## Opportunities

Mentorship has been a rewarding experience for me. Learning from the Performance Engineering Team and sharing that knowledge with my fellow team members has enriched my understanding and enhanced the team's capabilities. I am enthusiastic about exploring new opportunities to collaborate, learn, and contribute to projects that align with my expertise and interests.

## Problem Solving
On the Business Application Engineering Team I am often called on to research and find a solutions. One such example is the research for MyVault. The research of MyVault is crucial to identify programs that open us to security risks that need to be encrypted. A solution from the research I implemented was put into place a Sonar Rule that prevents this possible data leakage.
